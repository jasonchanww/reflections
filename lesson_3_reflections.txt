When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there is a need to synchronize the work between more than one person or computer. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is to keep operation pushing and pulling as logical steps and avoid unnecessary conflicts when working on the same file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: Clone a project remotely. When creating a new project based on an existing one.
Clone: Clone a project to local repository. Copying a remote project and work on it locally.
Branch: A separate set of commits within the repository. Create a separate version of project while keeping the stable version unchanged.
